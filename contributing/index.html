<h3>Contributing to GDC</h3>

<p> GDC is currently developed by a very small group.  While the addition of
a D front-end to GCC represents a great step forward for D, it also represents
an informal promise by the D community to keep the D frontend up to date with
the latest GCC development.

<p>Thanks to Github and Git, contributing to GDC is as easy as forking the
repository and submitting a pull request (although this workflow will likely
change when the merge is officially complete), and filing a bug report is a
simple web form.

<p>If you use GDC, we encourage you to try to contribute, whether by submitting
bugfixes, new features, documentation updates, web page improvements, etc.
In the past, GDC has nearly died due to poor communication and lack of
development.  Avoiding those issues is easier than ever before, but GDC will
always need a community that's willing to give back. 

<p>For access to the current development sources of GDC, visit
<a href="https://github.com/D-Programming-GDC/GDC">our git repository</a>.
Documentation on GDC is available from
<a href="http://wiki.gdcproject.org">the wiki</a>.

<p>If you are looking for a project to help improve GDC, check the
<a href="http://wiki.dlang.org/GDC/ProjectIdeas">project ideas</a> page.

<p>Work is currently under way to merge GDC into a future release of GCC.
Any assitance of any sort during this time would be invaluably appreciated.
