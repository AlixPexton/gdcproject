<h3>GDC Documentation</h3>

<p>At the moment, documentation for GDC, especially the internals, is sparse.
The DMD frontend and the GCC internals aren't very well documented either.
This page will hopefully help provide insight on GDC's internals. 

<p>GCC is a compiler for many languages and many targets, so it is divided
into pieces.

<ul>
<li>Front-End: Turns the source code into a language-independent representation
(<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/GENERIC.html">GENERIC</a>).
<li>Middle-End: Breaks down the GENERIC expressions into a lower level IL
used for target and language independent optimisations
(<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/GIMPLE.html">GIMPLE</a>).
<li>Back-End: Lowers the GIMPLE into a lower level IR and emits
target-specific assembler instructions
(<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/RTL.html">RTL</a>).
</ul>

<p>What we know as "GDC" is only an implementation of the Front-end part of
GCC.  GDC is located within its own subfolder in the core GCC source tree
(<i>gcc/d</i>).  It is within this subfolder that we must perform all changes
to the language.

<p>GCC has other front-ends such C (<i>gcc/c</i>), C++ (<i>gcc/cp</i>,
Java (<i>gcc/java</i>), and Go (<i>gcc/go</i>), etc.  You could look at these
for advice, but one probably shouldn't.

<p>The Middle-end uses callbacks to interface with the Front-end via
"lang_hooks" (See <i>gcc/d/d-lang.cc</i>).

<h3></h3>

<p>The D Front-end contains the lexer and parser.  These together turn the
source file into GENERIC.  The GDC frontend relies heavily on the Digital Mars
D (DMD) sources to perform this work, and you will find the entire DMD
Front-end sources in a subfolder (<i>gcc/d/dfrontend</i>).

<p>Other parts of the D Front-end outside this folder are part of GDC, and
implement various methods among the AST nodes.

<p>Most notably:
<ul>
<li>toIR (<i>gcc/d/d-toir.cc</i>): Defined for all Statement sub-classes.
Generates a statement expression, which have side effects but usually no
interesting value.
<li>toElem (<i>gcc/d/d-elem.cc</i>): Defined for all Expression sub-classes.
Generates an expression, be it an unary arithmetic, binary arithmetic,
function call, etc.
<li>toDt (<i>gcc/d/d-todt.cc</i>): Defined for all Initializer and certain
Expression sub-classes.  Generates a constant to be used as an initial value
for declarations.
<li>toObjFile (<i>gcc/d/d-objfile.cc</i>): Defined for all Declaration
sub-classes.  Generates a static variable or function declaration to be sent
to the Back-end.
<li>toSymbol (<i>gcc/d/d-decls.cc</i>): Defined for all Dsymbol sub-classes.
Generates a given symbol, which could be any kind of global, local, or field
declaration.
<li>toCtype (<i>gcc/d/d-ctype.cc</i>): Defined for all Type sub-classes.
Generates the type object code as is represented in the GCC Back-end.
</ul>

<p>Currently work is under way in upstream DMD to convert all these methods
into Visitor classes.  So expect the convention of these to change pretty
soon.
